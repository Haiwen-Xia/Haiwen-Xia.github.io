I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), currently enrolled in the 23rd [Experimental Class in Intelligence Science and Technology("Zhi Class")](https://zhi-class.ai/). 

My research interests and skills are concentrated in the fields of Artificial Intelligence. I have strong interests in Foundational Generation Models and their downstream applications in fields such as Decision Making and Music. I have experience in Openworld Agents and Music Information Retrieval.  <!--My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.-->
